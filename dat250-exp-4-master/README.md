# dat250-sparkjava-counter

Exp1 
I found to work with REST APIs and the Spark/Java framework for implementing microservices wasnt easy for me spesially the exp 2 and this is beacuse i weren't with the day lesson was showed about this topic.
I used really alot of time to do this experiment beacuse i need to read and to research on the web. 
The exp 1 was easy beacuse was just to work with postman tool, i think this is a usefull tool and i could do it beacuse i have been working in the big proyect with postman.
the exp 2 was more dificult to me i didnt know how sparkjava works in java and unfortunately i weren in taht lesson s√• i have to see some tutorials in youtube to try to do right. The code work i think but i think i could do better.
